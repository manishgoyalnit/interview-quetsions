/*In Coding blocks test Kartik bhaiya gave students an array of n non-negative integers a1, a2, â€¦, an ,where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). The task is to find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.

Input Format
First line contains integer n as size of array. Next n lines contains a single integer as elements of array.

Constraints
n>=2

Output Format
Output maximum water the container contains
